## Calling API

`import { handleApi } from "@/utilities";`

`handleApi` is the function used to call api.

Input:

- method: string, "get" or "post"

- action: string, api url

- data: any | undefined, api data

### Case 1: Submit form data to api

i.e. sign in or register, which will submit email and password.

You need a `<form>` element in the html.

`import { getFormData } from "@/utilities";`

`getFormData` will retrieve the data specified from the form.

`const apiData = getFormData(this.$refs.form, ["email", "password"]);`

You need to apply `name="email"` and `name="password"` on the corresponding `<input>` element inside the `<form>` for `getFormData` to work.

`handleApi("post", "/api/user/signin", apiData)`

`this.$refs.form` refers to the form holds the data. Use `ref="form"` on the `<form>` element. Each form should have unique name.

### Case 2: Submit form data and additional data to api

i.e. when registering, also add recaptcha response to the data.

You need a `<form>` element in the html.

`const apiData = getFormData(this.$refs.form, ["email", "password"]);`

After you got the data from the form, also apply your additional data to apiData:

apiData["recaptch"] = "response";

then call the `handleApi` as normal.

`handleApi("post", "/api/user/register", apiData)`

### Case 3: No need to submit form data to api

i.e. sign out the user, refresh the user status.

You don't need a `<form>` element in the html.

Just call the `handleApi` with `{}`

`handleApi("post", "/api/user/status", {})`

### Get the response data

`handleApi` will return a `Promise`.

Please call `then` function on it.

`handleApi("method", "action", apiData).then(`

`(response) => {`

`if (parseInt(response.data.code) === 200) {`

`// Api successful, you can acess response.data.data.`

`} else {`

`// Api failed. Please show the error.message to user.`

`}`

`},`

`(error) => {`

`// Error connecting to the api. Please show the error.message to the user.`

`}`

`);`

Notice: Don't forget parseInt on code as the data from backend is all string. Don't forget response.data.data (two data).
