### `/api/user/status`:

Gets the status of the user. Can be used to check if the session has signed in, get email address, check if the user has verified its email address, and get user id.

#### Request:

#### Response:

- code: number, 200 if successful, 403 if not signed in.

Note: If api fails, i.e. not 200 code, it will have following structure:

- code: number, error code.

- data: array

    - reason: string, reason for the error, needs to be presented to the user on the UI.

## Calling API

`import { handleApi } from "@/utilities";`

`handleApi` is the function used to call api.

Input:

- method: string, "get" or "post"

- action: string, api url

- data: any | undefined, api data

### Case 1: Submit form data to api

i.e. sign in or register, which will submit email and password.

You need a `<form>` element in the html.

`import { getFormData } from "@/utilities";`

`getFormData` will retrieve the data specified from the form.

`const apiData = getFormData(this.$refs.form, ["email", "password"]);`

You need to apply `name="email"` and `name="password"` on the corresponding `<input>` element inside the `<form>` for `getFormData` to work.

`handleApi("post", "/api/user/signin", apiData)`

`this.$refs.form` refers to the form holds the data. Use `ref="form"` on the `<form>` element. Each form should have unique name.

### Case 2: Submit form data and additional data to api

i.e. when registering, also add recaptcha response to the data.

You need a `<form>` element in the html.

`const apiData = getFormData(this.$refs.form, ["email", "password"]);`

After you got the data from the form, also apply your additional data to apiData:

apiData["recaptch"] = "response";

then call the `handleApi` as normal.

`handleApi("post", "/api/user/register", apiData)`

### Case 3: No need to submit form data to api

i.e. sign out the user, refresh the user status.

You don't need a `<form>` element in the html.

Just call the `handleApi` with `[]`

`handleApi("post", "/api/user/status", [])`

### Get the response data

`handleApi` will return a `Promise`.

Please call `then` function on it.

`handleApi("method", "action", apiData).then(`

`  (response) => {`

`    if (parseInt(response.data.code) === 200) {`

`      // Api successful, you can acess response.data.data.`

`    } else {`

`      // Api failed. Please show the error.message to user.`

`    }`

`  },`

`  (error) => {`

`    // Error connecting to the api. Please show the error.message to the user.`

`  }`

`);`

Notice: Don't forget parseInt on code as the data from backend is all string. Don't forget response.data.data (two data).
